## Doctrine lock

Governing doctrine added in PR #2. The source-truth boundary, governing doctrine, lane ownership, and non-authorization/hold rules are now in `02_GOVERNING_DOCTRINE/`.

The package is not runnable for schema production. Truth pack, operator prompts, validators, and the final runnable handoff are pending in later PRs.

Truth pack added in PR #3. Homepage scoped truth view and fingerprint are now in `03_TRUTH_PACK/`. Contact/social/logo owner approval worksheet is present — all fields default to NOT_REVIEWED.

Schema profile added in PR #4. Homepage schema profile (`HOMEPAGE_SCHEMA_PROFILE`), blocked module policy, held field categories, allowed modules list, and decision matrix are now in `07_REFERENCE_LISTS/`. All 15 held field categories default to NOT_REVIEWED_HELD. No schema output has been created.

The package is not runnable for schema production. Evidence maps, operator prompts, validators, and the final runnable handoff are pending in later PRs.

Next doctrine dependency: standalone master flow — PR #5.
